A gradient with a little noise to it, this spacer block will add visual interest to your posts and pages.

== Description ==

Inspired by the [grainy gradient trend](https://css-tricks.com/grainy-gradients/), this block is a decorative element you can add to your site. It can be used as a separator between content, or put it in a column next to text to jazz up your posts.

You can control the block's height, the gradient used, and the "grain type". There are 4 variations of the block with different grain textures: a default noise texture, horizontal lines, vertical lines, and a large, blobby texture (which reminds me of a lava lamp).
